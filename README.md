## Project Title

GBDA302 Week 4 Example 4: layable Maze (JSON + Level class + Player class)

---

## Authors

Karen Cochrane and David Han

Code modified by Jisoo Lee

---

## Description

Based on example 3, creates and positions the player using preloads and loadJSON files.

Modified code adds in wall, floor, character sprites, as well as randomized map generation in one of the levels. Also adds in some cool shadow effects to limit your visibility when navigation the rooms.

There is also 2 extra levels!

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Loads JSON levels (preload)
- Builds Level objects
- Creates/positions the Player
- Handles input + level switching

It is intentionally light on "details" because those are moved into:

- Level.js (grid + drawing + tile meaning)
- Player.js (position + movement rules)

## Assets

All pixel art sprite assets are created by Jisoo Lee

---

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han but they used GenAI to write the comments.

Modified code has no GenAI use.
